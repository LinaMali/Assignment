            <th>France</th>
            <td>This metal tower with three floors stands in the city centre of Paris. 
                It was built for the 1889 World Fair (Universal Expo) to celebrate the 100th anniversary
                 of the French Revolution.
                The 324metres/1062ft high Eiffel Tower was constructed by Auguste Eiffel and a team of engineers. 
                If you would like to take the steps up to the tower viewing platform on the second floor, 
                there are 704 steps to climb, but luckily there are also lifts in each of the leg up to the second floor.             
                The tower has been visited by over 250 million people since its opening and in 2016 more
                 than 7 million visitors were welcomed on the tower's top platform! </td>

           <th>Great Wall</th>
           <th>China</th>
           <td>The Great Wall is one of the seven wonders of the world. It runs in sections over a very long distance
             across China. The wall is also referred to as ‘Long Wall’ as it is over 21,196 km/13,171 miles long. 
             It was built with stones, bricks and tiles, earth as well as of wooden material. 
             The wall was completed in 1644, but it took more than 2,000 years to build.           
            There are more than 20,000 watchtowers along the wall as it was built to protect the country 
            against invasions from nomads and enemies and to make it easier to collect duty for goods that were 
            transported along the Silk Road.          
            Today the wall is the most popular tourist attraction in China with more than 10 million visitors per year.
            Contrary to popular belief the Great Wall cannot be seen from the moon! </td>

            <th>Kremlin</th>
            <th>Russia</th>
            <td>The Grand Kremlin Palace is part of the Kremlin complex and is located next to the Red Square and St Basil’s Cathedral in Russia’s capital city Moscow.
                The Kremlin is a fortress with enclosing walls and is built along the Moskva River. 
                The name ‘Kremlin’ means ‘fortress within a city’.
                 The more than 500-year-old Kremlin includes the wall with its 20 towers as well as four churches and five 
                 palaces within the walls. The Kremlin was once the residence of the Tzars.
                 Today, it is where the Russian president resides. The Cathedral of Vasily the Blessed,
                usually refered to as Saint Basil’s Cathedral, is easily recognised due to its nine brightly 
                coloured onion domes. </td>

            <th>Leaning Tower of Pisa </th>
            <th>Italy</th>
            <td>The Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of Italy’s major tourist attractions. The freestanding bell tower of the Pisa Cathedral was built over almost two hundred years and was finished in 1399.
                The original hight of the tower was 60 meters/196ft, but as it is leaning, the lowest side is now less than 56 meters/184ft. The construction already caused many problems as the soil was 
                soft, sandy and unstable. Already during construction, the builders tried to balance the leaning side with more columns on the other side, but the tower still leaned - 
                like many other buildings in the area.         
                In 2000, the tower was strengthened by putting stronger soil underneath the tower.
                 You can walk up the 251 stairs to the viewing platform at the top of the tower which is quite an amazing experience.
                 And of course take a picture of you from the lawns next to the tower to 'hold' the tower.</td>

            <th> Sydney Opera House</th>
            <th>Australia</th>
            <td>The Sydney Opera House, built in Australia’s biggest city, is famous for its roof’s architecture resembling shells or sails.
                 The opera house was designed by Jørn Utzon from Denmark and it was built between 1959 and 1973.
                The roof is covered with more than 1 million roof tiles. These were manufactured in Sweden. 
                The opera house has several performance halls and theatre and exhibition spaces.             
                More than 40 shows are staged here every week. Every year, more than 8 million visitors visit this
                 Australian landmark! Every evening the roof is lit up in a colourful spectacle.</td>
