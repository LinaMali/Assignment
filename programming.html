             <td>C is one of the high-level programming languages developed by Dennis Ritchie.
                C was originally developed for UNIX operating system to beat the issues of previous languages such as B, BCPL, etc.
                  The UNIX operating system development started in the year 1969, and its code was rewritten in C in the year 1972. 
                The UNIX operating system development started in the year 1969, and its code was rewritten in C in the year 1972.
                In 1985, Windows 1.0 was released. Even though Windows source code isn’t publicly available on the market, 
                it’s been stated that its kernel is mostly written in C.      
                In 1991, Linux kernel development started, and it’s additionally written in C.          
                After a year it was released under the GNU license and was used as part of the GNU Operating System.            
                The GNU operating system was started using C and Lisp programming languages. So, many of its components 
                are written in C.In 1977, Oracle database development started, and in 1983 its code was rewritten from 
                assembly to C. It became one in all the foremost widespread databases within the world.</td>

                    for creating large-scale applications. C++ is a superset of the C language. A related programming 
                    language, Java, is based on C++ but optimized for the distribution of program objects in a network 
                    such as the Internet.</td>
