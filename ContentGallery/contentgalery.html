                 happen to live in a sunny spot. Bougainvillea can grow 20–30 feet tall and wide, and its beautiful 
                 color-saturated flowers make a major impact.

                 is it. Not only does this climbing vine look romantic, it smells amazing too and will fill the space

                  them into otherwise staid bouquets for a bit of happy whimsy; you should do the same for tabletop 
                  arrangements.</th>
