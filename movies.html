        <h1><b><font style="color: rgb(224, 96, 145);">Shabaash Mithu</font></b></h1>
        <h3><b>15 July 2022.</b></h3>
        <b><p>Shabaash Mithu opens with a dejected Mithali Raj (Taapsee Pannu), drenched in sweat, 
            sprinting through the quiet bylanes of Hyderabad. The film hits the rewind button where 
            we get a peek into Mithali's childhood. When a young, exquisite Mithali strikes a friendship
             with the sharp-tongued, tomboyish Noorie at her classical dance classes, little does she know 
             that it would change the course of her life forever. Amid sessions of 'nritta', 'natya' and 'nritya',
              the girls sneak out to play cricket at an abandoned ground where a washing paddle is their cricket bat,
               and stones lying there double up as their fielders. During one such match, Mithali's exceptional
                cricketing skills catch the eye of Samrat (Vijay Raaz), a cricket coach. He offers to take 
                Mithali and Noorie under his wings. While Mithali's father agrees to this, Noorie keeps it 
                a secret from her family. Years pass by, and this 'Sachin-Kambli' duo is now slowly making
                 their mark with the bat and ball. However, owing to certain circumstances, only Mithali gets 
                 selected in the Indian National Women's Team. What follows next is the journey of her glorious 
                 career which is marked with hits and misses</p></b>
